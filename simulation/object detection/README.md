# Requirements

This simulation utilises three turtlebot burger with 5 distinct targets in a room

## Target Constraints
1. 5 distinct target objects (color, shape, size)
2. simple geometry
3. flat bottom
4. spaces between object is not too small (haven't decided) 

## Room Constraints

## Key Milestone
### Detecting all objects available in the room

### Classifying objects
#### Other Robots | Objects
#### Other Robots | Objects | Targets
#### Classify Targets based on
1. based on color
2. based on shape
3. based on size
4. based on type e.g. box, furniture, etc
