# ISE AI Final Project: Collective Transport using Swarm Robotics


What should the main file do?
import all the dependacy for the simulation to work
- TODO: Localised all them first 
- For now, there's a known map
- Each robot, will init by broadcasting the id of each
- Object detection and roam around. RANDOM. (Obj is already in map not detected)
- One Robot will detec the object. -> 1 robot ask to be the master, if everybody agrees, taskmaster will assigned each "path" for *all* of the robots.
- Program ends at all robots at the object
