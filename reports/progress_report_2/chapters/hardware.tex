We have encountered issues with reusing old motors and robots from RoboCup Soccer. The Hall effect sensor and the optical sensor have worn out. To address this, we designed and 3D-printed a bracket to mount the Maxon EC 45 Flat motor along with the AS5600 magnetic encoder. We are currently testing the motor to achieve closed-loop control. The motors in the robot are custom-made, and we do not know the number of pole-pairs, making calibration more challenging. We are using the SimpleFOCmini V1.0 drive board, which utilizes the powerful SimpleFOC library for testing.

The next step, after achieving closed-loop control, is to purchase additional motor drivers and control all four wheels. This will allow us to properly drive the X-Drive omnidirectional system using an Arduino, which will then be abstracted to operate under ROS.
