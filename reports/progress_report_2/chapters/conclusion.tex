\chapter{Conclusion}

\paragraph*{}
In conclusion, most tasks are progressing according to the project timeline. Some completed tasks may require additional enhancements due to other modules' dependencies. The current progress is satisfactory from our perspective and we will continue moving towards the MVP in this pace.

\paragraph*{}
For communication, there were a few minor issues with the consensus algorithm at the time of the previous progress report, briefly outlined in the \textit{Combine Individual Modules in Simulation} chapter, hence why we are wrapping it up in this iteration. However, the communication module is one where the requirements will constantly change, so it is essential to implement it as a module to adapt to any future demands.

\paragraph*{}
Simple robot formation acceptance criteria is when robots are able to dynamically assign paths without any movement conflicts. It is currently able to perform accordingly, thoroughly discussed in the \textit{Simple Robot Formation} chapter, thus the satisfactory progress. Future enhancements will include inputs from other modules such as SLAM and Object Detection to identify any movement obstacles and plan paths that avoid them.
