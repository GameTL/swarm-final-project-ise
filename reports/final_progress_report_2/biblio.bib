abstract = {The 3D printing technique known as Material Extrusion (MEX) was initially employed for prototyping, but it has evolved to fit applications in mechanical and biomedical industries. Polylactic acid (PLA) stands out as a commonly used polymer for manufacture pieces by MEX, due to its good properties and organic origins. Pursuing renewable and biodegradable thermoplastics has led to the development materials such as composite of PLA with wood fibers and blends with poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB). This study aims to characterize the effect of the most relevant printing parameters on the mechanical properties of a PLA/PHB blend, motivated by the interest to facilitate the use of this type of materials in industrial applications. To achieve it, compressive and fatigue tests were carried out, comparing the results with those obtained in previous studies for pure PLA and PLA-wood composite. Results show that the compressive behavior of PLA/PHB is influenced by the layer height, nozzle diameter and fill density. Its fatigue behavior is mainly determined by the nozzle diameter and the fill density. Moreover, the mechanical performance of PLA/PHB (Young's Modulus of 1.67 GPa, yield Strength of 33.8 MPa and maximum fatigue life of 9711 cycles) is inferior compared to pure PLA and PLA-wood composite. Despite the increase in the biodegradability that PHB introduces into PLA, the findings of this study reveal that there is statistically evidence that it can also hinder the mechanical performance of the base material.}
