\chapter{Conclusion}

\paragraph*{}
The progress for implementing effective communication in the swarm is behind schedule due to the move from decentralized to centralized with respect to communication. This allows for more flexibility in the protocol we can use for communication, with socket communication and MQTT being two major contenders. Once the advantages and disadvantages have been thoroughly considered, communication implementation will be able to continue with the most viable protocol for our use case as the solution. 

\paragraph*{}
For the next phase of our project, we will complete the tasks that have yet to be completed during the previous iteration and move towards a complete swarm. This includes completing the hardware requirements, considering movement after gripping, as well as testing and evaluation. Additionally, we will proceed with other tasks as scheduled in the Gantt Chart to ensure all project milestones are met.
