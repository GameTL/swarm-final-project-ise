\chapter{Introduction}

\paragraph*{}
This progress report aims to highlight the progress of our final project, \textbf{Collective Transport using Swarm Robotics}, with the evaluating criteria being the team individual contributions, as well as our pace in comparison to the ideal schedule. The ideal schedule can be represented by the project Gantt Chart (Figure \ref{fig:gantt_chart}).

\paragraph*{}
According to Figure \ref{fig:gantt_chart}, we are exploring four major sub-tasks during this iteration of the project schedule. These four tasks are: \textbf{Communication in the Swarm} (Task 1.1), \textbf{Simple Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) in Simulation} (Task 1.2), \textbf{Coordinated Gripping and Formation} (Task 1.3), and \textbf{Object detection} (Task 1.4). These tasks are planned to span from January to the second week of March. The results of the endeavours will be discussed in the following chapters
