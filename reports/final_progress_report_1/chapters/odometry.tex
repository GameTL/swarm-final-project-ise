Currently, we have three main sources of information to predict a robot's position: wheel odometry, LiDAR odometry, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). Each candidate has its own pros and cons in terms of accuracy and efficiency. This section will go through the tests and evaluation of each device and provide solutions to our problems regarding the robot's pose.

Briefly go through what we faced with imu, LiDAR, and Odometry...
For wheel encoder odometry in four-wheeled omnidirectional mobile robots, the motor controls each wheel independently, resulting in total control of the robot's movements in the 2-D plane. The measurements from the rotational movements of the encoders can help us determine the distance traveled by the wheel through mathematical calculations.
AX-12W presents a complete interface for reading and writing the motor status. As for wheel odometry, the main data we are interested in specifically are the present position and speed of the motor. With a baud rate of 1M, and the ability to bulk-read all motors instantaneously, we presume that our motors will be well adapted to the robot's pose estimation model.
