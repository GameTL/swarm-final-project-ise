\paragraph*{}
Currently, we have three main sources of information to predict a robot's position: wheel odometry, LiDAR odometry, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). Each candidate has its own pros and cons in terms of accuracy and efficiency. This section will go through the tests and evaluation of each device and provide solutions to our problems regarding the robot's pose.
