\chapter*{Abstract}

\paragraph*{}The rapid advancements in robotics have created significant opportunities to address complex tasks through collaborative systems. This report explores the project \textbf{"Collective Transport using Decentralised Swarm Robotics"}. The core problem addressed is the difficulty of achieving effective collaboration between decentralised robots, particularly in tasks such as collectively transporting objects in unstructured environments. Unlike centralised systems, which are vulnerable to single-point failures, decentralised swarm systems offer robust, scalable, and efficient solutions.

This document provides an in-depth analysis of key components, including communication protocols, object detection, localisation, SLAM, and hardware integration. It also includes a comprehensive literature review and a solid theoretical framework underpinning the projectâ€™s objectives. The report is organised into nine chapters, beginning with an introduction and a comprehensive literature review, followed by an overview of the simulation. Subsequent chapters delve into the primary aspects of the project: communication, object detection, localisation, SLAM, and robot formation.

\paragraph*{}This report summarises the progress achieved during this semester and provides a comprehensive overview of our work on the project.
