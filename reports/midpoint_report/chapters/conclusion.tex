\chapter{Conclusion}

\paragraph*{}
In conclusion, most tasks are progressing according to the project timeline. Some completed tasks may require additional enhancements due to other modules' dependencies. The current progress is satisfactory and according to the requirements, the Minimum Viable Prototype within the simulation has been completed.

\paragraph*{}
Our group’s next steps will focus on two key tasks, both happening in parallel to ensure steady progress. On one side, we will test the Graph SLAM algorithm within the Webots simulation. This step is essential for evaluating the algorithm's performance in mapping and localization under simulated conditions that resemble real-world scenarios. The results will allow us to identify any potential issues and make improvements before moving to physical testing.

\paragraph*{}
Meanwhile, other members of our team will shift their focus to hardware development. This involves creating detailed 3D designs for the robot’s components to ensure they meet the required strength and functionality standards. Once the designs are finalized, the team will move on to assembling the hardware, which includes integrating sensors, motors, and processing units. By advancing both the software and hardware tasks simultaneously, we aim to create a seamless integration that will lead to a fully functional robot capable of successfully demonstrating our system.
