\chapter*{Abstract}
\paragraph*{}This document serves as the final report for our project, \textbf{"Collective Transport using Swarm Robotics"}, providing an in-depth overview of its various components, including communication protocols, object detection, localization, SLAM, and hardware integration. Additionally, it offers a detailed review of existing literature and a solid theoretical framework to support the project's objectives. The report is structured into nine chapters, beginning with an introduction and a comprehensive literature review, followed by an overview of the simulation. It then delves into the core aspects of the project: communication, object detection, localization, SLAM, and robot formation.

\paragraph*{}This report encapsulates the progress made during this semester and serves as a comprehensive summary of our work on this project.
